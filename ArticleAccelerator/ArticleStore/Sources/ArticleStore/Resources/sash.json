The art of sash tying is a skill that younger Biodomers learn through a rigorous training process, and mastering these intricate knots not only displays your proficiency but also instills a sense of pride and unity.\nTo tie the biodome uniform sash, follow these step-by-step instructions:\n<OL><LI>Begin with a clean slate: Lay the sash flat on a surface, ensuring it's wrinkle-free and free from any creases. The sash will be more manageable and the final product will look neater if it's unwrinkled.</LI><LI>Position the sash: Place the sash around your shoulders, ensuring the longer end is on your left side and the shorter end is on your right. The sash should hang loosely over your chest, with the ends reaching down to your waist.</LI><LI>Create the first loop: Take the longer end of the sash on your left and bring it up and over your right shoulder. This creates the first loop that will form the basis of the knot.</LI><LI>Make the second loop: Now, take the same end of the sash (the one that's still on your left) and bring it down towards your left hip, then up and over your right shoulder again. This motion creates the second loop, which should sit on top of the first loop.</LI><LI>Pull and adjust: Gently pull both ends of the sash to tighten the loops around your shoulders. Ensure that the loops are not too loose or too tight, as they should comfortably sit on your shoulders without slipping off.</LI><LI>Cross the left end over the right: Take the left end of the sash that is now hanging down in front of you and cross it over the right end. This step creates the basic outline of the knot.</LI><LI>Pass the right end under and through: Take the right end of the sash and pass it under the left end that's now lying on top of it. This action creates the first half of the knot.</LI><LI>Complete the knot: Pull the right end gently to tighten the knot, then pass the same end under the left end again, pulling it through to complete the second half of the knot. The knot should now be secure and sitting snugly between your shoulders.</LI><LI>Adjust the ends: Gently tug on the ends of the sash to ensure they're even and neatly aligned. The sash should sit comfortably on your shoulders, with the knot positioned at the center of your chest.</LI><LI>Optional embellishments: Depending on your role and status within the biodome, additional embellishments, beads, or charms can be added to the sash to further personalize it and denote your accomplishments.</LI></UL>\nRemember, the art of sash tying isn't just about the final product, but also the process of honing your skills and fostering a sense of community and responsibility within the biodome. As Biodomers, when you take pride in your uniform and the sash you wear, you become more deeply connected to the mission and the ecological balance you strive to maintain."},"media":{"image":{"_0":{"original":".\/sash.original.png","list":".\/sash.list.png","grid":".\/sash.grid.png","heroFull":".\/sash.hero-full.png","heroMini":".\/sash.hero-mini.png"},"_1":"An exciting image"}},"duration":682.0541157880805,"question":{"prompt":"Which of the following isn't one of the benefits of sash tying?","choices":[{"id":"AD89EC1A-4DC7-4147-9128-97E476E732DE","justification":"Sash wearing promotes biodome pride.","isCorrect":false,"possibleAnswer":"Pride and unity"},{"possibleAnswer":"Proficiency and skill","justification":"Biodome robots are capable of tying sashes.","id":"4DA775BF-5488-47E6-AE5A-51DF964C7934","isCorrect":false},{"possibleAnswer":"Self-defense","isCorrect":true,"id":"EBA51B0F-3EDA-41B6-B163-1ECE7C3986E4","justification":"Sashes provide limited protection in the biodome."}]},"body":[]}
