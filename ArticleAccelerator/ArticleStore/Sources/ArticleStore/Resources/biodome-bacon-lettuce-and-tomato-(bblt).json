{"hero":{"content":"The Biodome Bacon Lettuce and Tomato (BBLT) is a testament to the creativity and resourcefulness that you can achieve by utilizing the bounty of the biodome. The BBLT features classic BLT ingredients, including bacon, lettuce, and tomato, but with a twist - everything is grown and produced within the biodome itself. This not only enhances the flavor and freshness of the ingredients but also promotes a sustainable and eco-friendly approach to food consumption. The highlight of this recipe is the homemade mayonnaise, which is made from scratch using ingredients such as biodome-grown eggs and lemons. This adds a touch of creamy delight to the sandwich while showcasing the versatility of biodome-grown produce.","id":"4004C4BE-3D9C-4B5D-860B-54888C1BFE1B","header":"Biodome Bacon Lettuce and Tomato (BBLT)"},"duration":321.3867853928713,"date":730689299.2112947,"question":{"choices":[{"isCorrect":true,"possibleAnswer":"JurassiCola","justification":"The heavy water used in JurassiCola will curdle the eggs.","id":"9DB221DE-54DD-42F1-AC0E-9C8C1C1EBFE8"},{"isCorrect":false,"possibleAnswer":"Egg","justification":"Eggs are abundant and an important ingredient of mayonnaise.","id":"3A6C89CE-D51C-4C1F-8562-A7BDA69680D8"},{"justification":"Salt and pepper are key to a good tasting mayonnaise.","possibleAnswer":"Salt and pepper","isCorrect":false,"id":"832141D4-BD9E-4E80-B85E-77E0AFB84716"}],"prompt":"Which of the following isn't an ingredient of mayonnaise in a BBLT?"},"body":[{"content":"2 slices of bread  \n1-2 lettuce leaves  \n1 tomato  \n2 slices of bacon  \nHomemade mayonnaise:\n1 egg  \n1 tablespoon of lemon juice  \n1\/2 cup of oil  \nSalt and pepper to taste  ","header":"Ingredients","id":"A27FBD3A-77BF-4988-B287-6890F8211FD8"},{"content":"**Make the mayonnaise**\n<OL><LI>In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.</LI><LI>Slowly drizzle in the oil while whisking constantly until the mixture thickens and emulsifies into mayonnaise.</LI><LI>Set aside.</LI></OL>\n**Cook the bacon**\n<OL><LI>Preheat a skillet over medium heat, and add the bacon slices.</LI><LI> Cook for several minutes until crispy, flipping halfway through.</LI><LI>Drain on a paper towel.</LI></OL>\n**Toast the bread**\n<OL><LI>Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise on the bread.</LI><LI>Place the bread slices in the preheated skillet, mayonnaise side down, and toast for a few minutes until golden brown.</LI><LI>Remove from the skillet and set aside.</LI></OL>\n**Assemble the sandwich**\n<OL><LI>Take one piece of toasted bread, and spread a layer of homemade mayonnaise on it.</LI><LI>Place a lettuce leaf on top of the mayonnaise.</LI><LI>Slice the tomato into thin slices, and arrange them on top of the lettuce.</LI><LI>Add the crispy bacon slices on top of the tomato.</LI><LI>Finish by placing the second toast slice on top of the bacon to complete the sandwich.</LI></OL>","header":"Instructions","id":"8DD731E1-01B7-423C-B48D-AB50216880A4"}],"media":{"image":{"_1":"An exciting image","_0":{"grid":".\/bblt.grid.png","heroFull":".\/bblt.hero-full.png","heroMini":".\/bblt.hero-mini.png","list":".\/bblt.list.png","original":".\/bblt.original.png"}}},"id":"BB851F21-94D5-4CDF-B6EF-F96A8ADD6481"}
